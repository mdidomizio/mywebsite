            <h3>By giving access to expert information, knowledge, and support, we encourage our users to better understand how physiology affects their wellbeing.
                We stand for...</h3>
            <p><span class="colored">Enabling you to take control of your health</span>
                We support women and everyone who menstruates throughout their entire reproductive lives, with personalised cycle predictions, virtual health assistants, insights on general health, fertility and pregnancy.
                <span class="colored">Providing expert health information to all</span>
                Expert, evidence-based health information should be unconditional and available to everyone. We work with a large team of medical doctors and female health organisations to provide health content you can trust.
                <span class="colored">Empowering open discussion</span>
                Many reproductive health topics are still taboo, and some questions may go unanswered. Through the power of community, we enable open discussions, end stigmas, and help you to get support from like-minded others.
